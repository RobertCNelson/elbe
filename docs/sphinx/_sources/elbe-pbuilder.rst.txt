NAME
====

elbe-pbuilder - High Level Interface to the ELBE Package Build System.
Allows to create a package builder for a project and to build Debian
packages.

.. __synopsis:

SYNOPSIS
========

   ::

      elbe pbuilder build  [--project <project> | --xmlfile <xmlfile>]
      elbe pbuilder create [--project <project> | --xmlfile <xmlfile>] [--writeproject <filename>]

.. __description:

DESCRIPTION
===========

Creates a pbuilder for a specified project and builds the Debian package
like pbuilder, but for the configured ELBE project.

Currently only the source formats 3.0 (git) and 3.0 (native) are
supported. 3.0 (quilt) requires Files in the parent directory, which are
not uploaded, because only the curent Workdirectory is uploaded.

.. __options:

OPTIONS
=======

--project <dir>
   *key* (/var/cache/elbe/<uuid> for the project inside the initvm to
   use. Use *elbe control list_projects* to get a list of the available
   projects. Another option would be to use the --writeproject option,
   when the pbuilder is created.

--xmlfile <xmlfile>
   This file is used to create a new ELBE project including the pbuilder
   environment.

--cpuset <int>
   When this value is not -1 (the default), the pbuilder is run using
   *taskset <cpuset>* which allows to limit the number of cpus used for
   the build. This is usefule when multithreading and qemu-user yield
   problem with e.g. java.

--profile string
   Specify the build profile to build. (dpkg-buildpackage -P<profile>)

.. __commands:

COMMANDS
========

*create*
   A pbuilder environment for the given project or xml File will be
   created.

*build*
   Build the *Debianized Project* in the current working directory. (A
   valid ./debian directory needs to exist.) If --project was specified,
   the specified build environment will be used. If --xmlfile is
   specified a new build environment will be created for the given ELBE
   XML File and the *Debianized Project* in the current working
   directory will be build. The result of the package build is stored in
   ../ like pbuilder does.

.. __examples:

EXAMPLES
========

-  Build a pbuilder for *myarm.xml*. Save project name into myarm.prj

   ::

      # elbe pbuilder create --xmlfile myarm.xml --writeproject myarm.prj

-  Use the pbuilder we have built, to build *program*, using the prj
   File generated in parent directory

   ::

      # cd program
      # elbe pbuilder build --project `cat ../myarm.prj`

-  Use the pbuilder we have built, to build *program*, using the prj
   File generated in parent directory. And dont use more than one CPU as
   a workaround for qemu-user and java problems.

   ::

      # cd program
      # elbe pbuilder build --project `cat ../myarm.prj` --cpuset 1
